### Introduction
This project analyzes the housing market in Mexico using real estate data. The goal is to explore whether home prices are influenced more by property size or location. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and visualization techniques such as histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation analysis. Insights are drawn for regional differences, with a special focus on the southern states.

And this is what I did: cleaned the data, created new features for latitude, longitude, and state, transformed prices to numeric values, explored the data through summary statistics and visualizations, and calculated correlations to understand the relationship between property size and price across different regions :

*Import libraries*

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
```
*Import the CSV file*

```python
df = pd.read_csv("data/mexico-real-estate.csv")
```
*Inspect the DataFrame*

```python
df.info()
df.head()
```
*Drop all rows with NaN values*

```python
df = df.dropna()
```
*Create separate columns "lat" and "lon" from "lat-lon"*

```python
df[['lat', 'lon']] = df['lat-lon'].str.split(',', expand=True).astype(float)
```
*Extract "state" from "place_with_parent_names"*

```python
df['state'] = df['place_with_parent_names'].str.split('|MÃ©xico|').str[1].str.strip()
```
*Transform "price_usd" to float*

```python
df['price_usd'] = df['price_usd'].str.replace('$','').str.replace(',','').astype(float)
```
*Drop "lat-lon" and "place_with_parent_names" columns*

```python
df = df.drop(columns=['lat-lon','place_with_parent_names'])
```
*Create summary statistics for "area_m2" and "price_usd"*

```python
summary_stats = df[['area_m2','price_usd']].describe()
summary_stats
```
*Create histogram of "price_usd"*

```python
plt.hist(df['price_usd'][:20000])
plt.xlabel("Price [USD]")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of Home Prices")
plt.show()
```
*Create horizontal boxplot of "area_m2"*

```python
plt.boxplot(df['area_m2'], vert=False)
plt.xlabel("Area [sq meters]")
plt.title("Distribution of Home Sizes")
plt.show()
```
*Mean home price by region*

```python
mean_price_by_region = df.groupby("region")['price_usd'].mean().sort_values()
mean_price_by_region
```
*Bar chart of mean home price by region*

```python
mean_price_by_region.plot(kind='bar')
plt.xlabel("Region")
plt.ylabel("Mean Price [USD]")
plt.title("Mean Home Price by Region")
plt.show()
```
*Create DataFrame for southern region*

```python
df_south = df[df['region'] == 'South']
```
*Number of homes by state in southern region*

```python
homes_by_state = df_south['state'].value_counts()
homes_by_state
```


```python
*Scatter plot for the state with most properties*
```


```python
largest_state = homes_by_state.idxmax()
df_south_state = df_south[df_south['state'] == largest_state]
plt.scatter(df_south_state['area_m2'], df_south_state['price_usd'])
plt.xlabel("Area [sq meters]")
plt.ylabel("Price [USD]")
plt.title(f"{largest_state}: Price vs. Area")
plt.show()
```


```python
*Correlation between area and price for southern states*
```


```python
south_states_corr = {state: df_south[df_south['state']==state]['area_m2'].corr(
    df_south[df_south['state']==state]['price_usd']) for state in df_south['state'].unique()}
south_states_corr
```
